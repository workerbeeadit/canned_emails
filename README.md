# canned_emails - A project to prove that I can spaghetti code if needed

## Problem
Product Mangers tend to write recurring emails many times a day. It's a lot of thinking and for a repetitive task, it really shouldn't be. Canned emails is a bunch of email templates that people can use to copy and paste into their email clients. 

I'll start with a very 1990s site using CSS, HTML (JSX really), Node, and React. It's all very unnecessary. 


## Milestones
V0 - A simple canned emails implementation. The user can easily see what's a canned email, copy and paste said email manually, and be on their way.

V1 - A better UI where users can click into canned email headings (aligned to the left) to see the content (aligned to the right) and manually copy.

V2 - If the user clicks anywhere near the body, the email template (body) should directly be copied to their clipboard

V3 - Users should have an option to send emails from their email client when they click on the email template.
